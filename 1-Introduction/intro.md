# What is Node.js?
Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source Javascript runtime environment. Node.js runs on the V8 Javascript engine, and execute javascript code outside the browser.

- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

- It is maintained by the OpenJS Foundation.

- Node.js allows JavaScript to be executed outside of a web browser.

This means that while JavaScript is traditionally associated with the web and
browsers, Node.js extends its reach, allowing you to run JavaScript code on
servers, desktops, and even embedded systems. This is why Node.js is often
described with the phrase "Run JavaScript Everywhere."
```

- Node.js features an event-driven architecture and supports asynchronous I/O (non-blocking I/O).
